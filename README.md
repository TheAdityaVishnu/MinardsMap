# MinardsMap

For the second task, we make use of the data of the ‘Minard Dataset’. Since the data is available in tabular format, we first process and convert it into JSON dataset format.

To replicate the Charles Joseph Minard’smap, we make use of the p5.js processing language. 

In the Minard’s map, we have shown the location of the Napoleon’s army during Russia’s 1812 campaign. The thickness of the lines on the map represents the size of the army.

From the figure, we notice that the Minard’s map suggest that Napoleon’s army started reducing in number due to freezing temperature, but on further literature review, it was found that this is not true. The reason for dwindling size of army was diseases andnot harsh temperature.
